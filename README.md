## Building
This will create java package, the docker image and push the image to docker hub
- ./sh/build.sh

## Deploy
This will pull the image from docker hub and start a container with it.
- ./sh/deploy.sh
 
Note that it will destroy any previous container of the same name. The data generated by the container is persisted under a volume.
