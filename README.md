# rtmdemo

## Overview
Big Data Demo, using
- RTM Open Data for trains position and delays in real-time
- Nifi as acquisition and transformation engine
- Azure Data Lake via WebHDFS for Data Lake Storage
- Azure Data Lake Analytics for batch transformation
- Power BI for Dashboards


## Pre-requisites
The following pre-requisites are needed for the project to be built and deployed properly
- CentOs 7.4+ with Docker CE installed
	- https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/#install-docker-ce
- xmvn installed 
	- sudo yum install xmvn
- Logged In to a docker-hub account (docker username is used to name the docker image)
	- docker login


## Configuration
Add your credentials to the rtmdemo.properties file.
- Copy the rtmdemo.properties.template file to rtmdemo.properties
	- cp conf/rtmdemo.properties.template conf/rtmdemo.properties
- Update the properties in the file with your own configuration.

Note that the file rtmdemo.properties is ignored by git (.gitignore) intentionally to avoid commiting credentials to GitHub by mistake


## Building
This will create java package, the docker image and push the image to docker hub into your own account
- ./sh/build.sh


## Deploy
This will pull the image from docker hub and start a container with it.
- ./sh/deploy.sh
 
Note that it will destroy any previous container of the same name. The data generated by the container is persisted under a volume.


## To Do
- Reorganize all files under a single Maven project
- Port build.sh and deploy.sh to Maven (pom.xml)

## Known Issues
- The field trip_updates.start_time sometimes contains an hour past 24h, i.e. 24h30 for example. This is flagged as an error by PowerBI when importing the data from the Data Lake.
